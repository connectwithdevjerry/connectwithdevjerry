# 👋 Hi, I’m Adedeji Jeremiah Obaloluwa (connectwithdevjerry)

A passionate Geospatial Developer and AI enthusiast from Nigeria. I build tools and prototypes that turn spatial data into actionable insights by combining Geospatial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and modern web technologies.

---

## About Me
I hold a B.Sc. in Surveying and Geoinformatics from Obafemi Awolowo University (CGPA: 4.74). My research focused on AI-based urban building extraction using drone imagery and DeepLabv3.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Geospatial Intelligence
- Machine Learning (GeoAI / Remote Sensing)
- Web GIS and spatial web development

---

## What I do
- Develop geospatial pipelines for spatio-temporal analysis and automated mapping
- Integrate platforms like Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS, PostGIS, and OpenStreetMap
- Build web GIS applications with Python, Django, React, and Node.js
- Prototype GeoAI solutions using deep learning on aerial/drone imagery

---

## Research & Projects
- AI-based urban building extraction from drone imagery (DeepLabv3)
- Spatio-temporal analysis and urban monitoring prototypes
- Open-source mapping experiments and geospatial tooling

(See pinned repositories for highlights and demos)

---

## Tech Stack
- Languages & Frameworks: Python, Django, Node.js, React
- Databases & Spatial: PostgreSQL / PostGIS
- Geospatial Platforms: Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS, OSM
- ML & Remote Sensing: Deep Learning (e.g., DeepLabv3), GeoAI workflows
- Dev & Deployment: Docker, Heroku, CI workflows
- UI: Tailwind CSS
